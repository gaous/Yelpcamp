# Yelpcamp

Frameworks and libraries used to create this website:
1. express
2. body-parser
3. connect-flash
4. ejs
5. locus
6. method-override
7. moment
8. mongoose
9. passport and a few more.

The app can be started with node if all the packages are set up properly.
Note: I have not attached all the dependencies in github. You can set up using npm.

And, yep, as you can see, the website was hosted in herokuapp. For the database part, mongodb was connected and used.
